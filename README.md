# Ordinal-regression
This repository contains SAS code and pdf report of my ordinal regression project. Based on data obtained from European social survey I tried to answer a question: What factors are shaping negative attitude towards homosexual people in France? The detailed analysis is presented in the pdf file. Dataset description can be find here: https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/docs/round9/survey/ESS9_data_protocol_e01_4.pdf
